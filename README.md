# TA-Helper
A simple repo to help grade hw for coding bootcamps.

# Description
This repo was originally some simple gulp tasks to help me and some of the other TA's grade homework. However as the course progressed I felt like it would be cool to build a lightweight cli for more advanced tasks like installing node in each project.
